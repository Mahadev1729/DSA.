   # when a fuction calls itself until a specific condition met
   # stackoverflow:when numrous recursive calls waiting in stack
   # base condition is required for recursion to avoid infinite calls
   # it follows some common template
   
 2.Bitmanipulation:
   # operation on bits
   # set bit 
   # count of flips  
 3.Binary search Method:
   #lower bound
   #Upper bound
   #sqrt of number
   #Nth root number 

 4.Trees
